Description: The package is designed to play the Monty Hall game, where there are
 three doors for a contestant to choose from, one of which has a car 
behind it and two have goats. The contestant selects a door, then the 
host opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is allowed
 to stay with their original selection or switch to the other unopened 
door. There was a famous debate about whether it was optimal to stay
 or switch when given the option to switch, so this simulation was 
created to test both strategies.
